RSLint is an extremely fast JavaScript linter written in Rust focusing on ease of use, customizability, and speed. RSLint
helps you find and fix error-prone productions in your code as well as enforce good practices.

<hr>

RSLint does not require [Node](https://nodejs.org) and has prebuilt binaries for Windows, Mac, and Linux but you are free to
compile the project from source to any target supported by Rust.
